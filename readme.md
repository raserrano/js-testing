# Javascript testing journey

In this project I will start to go through the different frameworks and testing tools to experience and share the knowledge that I will be also getting through this journey.

There are a few things that I would really like to start sharing. First of all, I sam trying to make everything from scratch and while this might not be the best approach for real life projects I intend this to do it as a way to slowly learn and leverage my knowledge on testing tools in Javascript specially aiming NodeJS. Another important aspect of this project is to demonstrate knowledge that is usually hard to share if you are not able to submit code to a public repository. Hopefully this will be interesting for readers and even some might find it useful.

I am also assuming no previous knowledge in the tools that I will be using and the experience and knowledge should be a good starting point for those following me in this journey as those that would like to start learning new skills.

## Tools being used
Without even realizing how hard getting started for someone without knowledge I am going to list the current set of technologies and tools I'm currently using.

### Simple
- Vim editor 
- Git
- NodeJS/Javascript
- Npm 
- N

I started this journey by basically creating a git repository. Given that most of the time the repository is already created for us I expect it to be something that not many have had the opportunity to do on their own. I created the repository by simple executing the following command
>`git init`

Obviously I already have git installed in the system. I will not cover git installation this time but I think I might create a docker container somewhere along the journey to provide a testing environment and also introduce the containerized topic.
